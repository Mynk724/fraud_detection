# fraud_detection
Autoencoder-based fraud detection identifies anomalies by learning normal transaction patterns through reconstruction. Trained on non-fraud data, it measures reconstruction error for new transactions. If the error exceeds a defined threshold, the system flags the transaction as potentially fraudulent.
